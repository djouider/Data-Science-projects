🦺 #Safety Gear Detection Challenge
In hazardous work environments, personal protective equipment is essential for ensuring worker safety. Detecting the presence of safety gear in images can help enforce compliance and prevent workplace accidents.

🚀 The Challenge
Your task is to build a multi-label image classification model that can identify people and detect whether they are wearing the required safety equipment. Each image may contain multiple labels, representing:

✅ Person
✅ Vest
✅ Blue Hat
✅ Red Hat
✅ White Hat
✅ Yellow Hat

This is a multi-label classification problem, meaning an image can have one or more labels at the same time.

🏆 Your Mission
You'll preprocess the data, extract meaningful features, and train a deep learning or machine learning model to accurately classify safety gear in images.
